# Translate Chat Bot using AI

I made this project in my pursuit to become a polyglot, as the world gets more connected I want to be able to practice my language skills, starting with an AI.

Third iteration:
Full functioning new chat using an object, API call per array in the said object, also allow the user to choose which language (scalable) and beginning AI prompt.

Second iteration:
Created different bots (a template) so users can choose between different languages, added a clear chat button to clear the current chat
